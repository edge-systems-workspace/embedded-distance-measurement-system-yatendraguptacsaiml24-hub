## 🚀 Project Overview

This project demonstrates distance measurement using an HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor and Arduino (Uno R4 recommended).

The system:

- Sends ultrasonic pulse
- Measures echo time
- Calculates distance
- Displays structured serial output
- Follows Doxygen documentation standards
- Enforces Git-based development discipline

This project introduces:

- Time-of-flight measurement
- Pulse signal generation
- Distance calculation logic
- Embedded system structuring

---

## 🔧 Hardware Requirements

- Arduino Uno R4
- HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor
- Breadboard
- Jumper wires
- USB cable

---

## 💻 Software Requirements

- Arduino IDE
- Git
- GitHub Account

---

## 🔌 Wiring Connections

| HC-SR04 Pin | Arduino |
|-------------|----------|
| VCC         | 5V       |
| GND         | GND      |
| TRIG        | Pin 9    |
| ECHO        | Pin 10   |

---

## ⚙ Working Principle

- TRIG pin sends a 10µs ultrasonic pulse.
- Sound wave travels and reflects from object.
- ECHO pin stays HIGH for duration of return time.
- Distance is calculated using time-of-flight formula:

Distance (cm) = (Duration × 0.0343) / 2

---

## 🧠 Code Structure

The system:

1. Initializes Serial communication
2. Configures TRIG and ECHO pins
3. Sends ultrasonic pulse
4. Measures echo duration
5. Calculates distance
6. Prints structured output
